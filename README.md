# Systems-and-Net-Programming
This repository contains various lab assignments completed as part of my System and Network Programming coursework. Each lab demonstrates a core concept in C programming, interprocess communication (IPC), networking, and cybersecurity.

Lab 1: Process Creation and Pipes
- Usage of `fork()`, `getpid()`, and unnamed pipes.
- 
 Lab 2: Process Synchronization
- Demonstrating parent-child sync using `wait()` and multiple processes.

 Lab 3: Named Pipes (FIFOs)
- IPC using FIFOs between unrelated processes.

 Lab 4: Socket Programming
- TCP and UDP socket communication between a server and clients.

 Lab 5: Distributed System
- Multi-client communication with synchronization across systems.


## How to Compile and Run

Each lab folder contains its own `.c` files. You can compile them using `gcc`. For example:

gcc server.c -o server
./server
